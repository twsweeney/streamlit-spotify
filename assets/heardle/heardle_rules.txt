This is a recreation of the game "Heardle" using your Spotify library. 

On the following screen you will click to play an audio snippet. The goal of the game is to
guess the name of the song and artist who made it. 

You will have 6 guesses to figure out the song. In each round you can play a longer snippet of 
the song. In round 1 you will only have 1.5 seconds of the song to identify it with. In round 
6 you will have 30 seconds of the song. 




Good luck!
